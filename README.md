# My-Python-Journey

This is a small collection of the steps i have taken to learn Python. 
From a book called 'Creative Coding in PYTHON', it is a beginners book but i do feel that a little more to this book on explanations could be given. 
With I have worked on other little projects as part of this book, but following the advise from a friend who is a software engineer. I am looking at another book to cement what i have learnt and give more informative on what things are and used for like 'Functions', 'Loops' and differences in uses.
I have not finished this book as it goes into the grafical side of coding, but with the recommendation I have been given I will come back to this with better informed coding practices.
